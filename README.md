# Milestone-Project
Hello and thank you for checking out my project! Here I present my simple version of a tic tac toe board

## What was your motivation?
I had created this board out to get my hand at seeing how it would be 
to try and get the basics of creating a tic tac toe board down.


## What did you learn?
 Over the timeframe of working on this project I had learned quite a good amount about how games keep track of all the pieces needed to produce a winning outcome. These include, what functions produce a winning combination, if the combos belong to the same player, how the winning score is handled and updated.


## Features for the future.
This is a definite starting point for the project, there is more stuff I would love to come back and add to this project when I can find time for it. The first thing I would do is make it look better. CSS/Colors certainly aren't my strong suit and I want to make it stand out and feel less empty. Potentially add in a mute button in case the player would prefer just to play without any audio in game. Adding in a Player vs AI mode as well in case they want to play just by themselves too. Adjusting the CSS so that win message does not overlap the grid/score  regardless of screen size.
